# CVIP-Web-Development-Internship
As an intern with Coder Cave, I was selected for web development. I got tasks to complete in two phases, and in each phase there was a golden task and a normal task. I came up with both the normal task as Netflix Clone Page and the golden task of creating an online code editor, for which I created a clone.

I undertook this internship project and completed it under the guidance of Coder Cave Management. I am grateful to their staff for their patience and assistance during my training. It was a good learning experience for me to work with them. These skills would help me expand my resume and advance my career.
